    "## **Problem 1: RLU Cache**\n",
    "## Least Recently Used Cache\n",
    "We have briefly discussed caching as part of a practice problem while studying hash maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lookup operation (i.e., `get())` and `put()` / `set()` is supposed to be fast for a cache memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "While doing the `get()` operation, if the entry is found in the cache, it is known as a `cache hit`. If, however, the entry is not found, it is known as a `cache miss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a cache, we also place an upper bound on the size of the cache. If the cache is full and we want to add a new entry to the cache, we use some criteria to remove an element. After removing an element, we use the `put()` operation to insert the new element. The remove operation should also be fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first problem, the goal will be to design a data structure known as a ***Least Recently Used (LRU) cache***. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. For the current problem, consider both `get` and `set` operations as an `use operation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to use an appropriate data structure(s) to implement the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In case of a `cache hit`, your `get()` operation should return the appropriate value.\n",
    "- In case of a `cache miss`, your `get()` should return -1.\n",
    "- While putting an element in the cache, your `put()` / `set()` operation must insert the element. If the cache is full, you must write code that removes the least recently used entry first and then insert the element.\n",
